# Byte Bard Blog Website

Welcome to the Byte Bard Blog Website, a project built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to showcase and manage blog posts. This project is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To run the development server, use one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Getting Started

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project leverages [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) for automatic optimization and loading of Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Features

- **Blog Optimization**: Automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font, for enhanced readability.
- **Blog Management**: Easily manage and showcase blog posts with the power of Next.js.

## Technical Features

- **Built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/):** A React framework for building web applications.
- **Desiging:**Utilizes [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) as a utility for styling components.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Majority of the website is rendered on the server side, providing optimized performance.
- **Efficient Data Fetching:** Utilizes Next.js built-in fetch function for data fetching with flexibility for manipulation.
- **Data Revalidation:** Implements revalidate function in Next.js for on-demand data revalidation, preventing unnecessary fetching.
- **Folder Structure:** Maintains a conventional folder structure for better organization.
- **Component Architecture:** Prefers smaller child components over larger client-side components for better maintainability.
- **Authentication:** Implements proper authentication through a custom backend server.
